My requirements were:
 "add a captcha to the forgot password page"

I looked on ruby-toolbox (http://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/rails_captcha.html) to see what plugins were being used and had good traction, and narrowed it to these three:

Simple-Captcha
    http://expressica.com/simple_captcha
		1. requires rmagick to create the image
		2. requires db:migrate to persist the keyed answer
		3. works well, easy enough to change

reCaptcha (sponsored by google)
   http://www.google.com/recaptcha
		1.commonly used, well tested, looks professional
		2. requires outbound http call, (may have to deal with proxies)
		3. can handle ssl
		4. can play audio if text is too hard
		5. expects String.html_safe (rails > 2.3.7), had to monkey patch a do nothing method
		6. has styling options, but I had problems getting it to look right in the form I was using 

BrainBuster
   https://github.com/rsanheim/brain_buster
		1. doesn't make 3rd party outbound call
		2. doesn't require rmagick
		3. does require a db table to store a set of questions
		4. presents the user with a set of logic questions
		5. by default uses cookies to flag that a user has answered successfully, but that can be turned off to always challenge the user
		6. handles numeric to text conversion when a user answers 'five' or '5'
